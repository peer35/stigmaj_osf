### Abstract ###
Purpose: This qualitative study examined the experience, manifestations, and impact of racial discrimination and substance abuse stigma, also known as a double stigma, among 10 African-American male substance users.Method: Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and analyzed for themes using Grounded Theory methodology.Results: Racial discrimination and substance abuse stigma were common experiences. In terms of a double stigma,interviewees perceived that their substance use problems were viewed differently, and less favorably, than the substance related disorders of non-minority clients. Spirituality also was an important aspect of coping for a majority of interviewees.Conclusions: This qualitative approach utilizing Grounded Theory was successful in collecting and summarizing the narrative experiences of double stigma among African American male substance users. A double stigma experienced by African-American males with substance related disorders may cause potentially harmful effects on treatment engagement and success.10.5463/sra.v1i1.3
