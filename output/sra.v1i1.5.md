### Abstract ###
Purpose: Stigma and discrimination faced by patients with schizophrenia are the most important barriers to accessing care and can result in long treatment delays. Stigma is universal but the nature, source, and impact of stigma vary across cultures and regions. Thus, interventions need to be specific. This study assessed the perceptions of patients with schizophrenia regarding the stigma and discrimination they face in their lives. Main determinants and sources of stigma, as well as the nature of and forms of stigma were of interest.Method: Opinions on various aspects of stigma were obtained using a semi-structured interview. One hundred patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, who were attending a psycho-education group in a hospital setting in Mumbai, India were surveyed.Results: The stigma and discrimination linked to schizophrenia was found to have a significant impact on the lives of these individuals. From the patient perspective, a lack of knowledge, the nature of the illness itself, and behavioral symptoms were seen as the main reasons for stigma and discrimination. Common effects of stigma were low self-esteem and discrimination in family and work settings. Providing care and treatment was identified as the most common method of combating stigma. The availability of effective treatment was thought to be the most important method of reducing stigma, which will certainly aid in the access of mental health care for patients globally.Conclusions: The stigma associated with schizophrenia represents a challenge for effective mental health care. The solution for minimizing this stigma through anti-stigma programs is essential and necessitates the collection and analysis of complex information, particularly including patient perceptions.Implications: Dealing with stigma should be part of treatment and psycho-educational programs. Better treatment and rehabilitation for the illness and its symptoms is important, but so is educating members of the community, who are viewed as the primary source of stigma and discrimination.10.5463/sra.v1i1.5
