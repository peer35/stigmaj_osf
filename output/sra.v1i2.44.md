### Abstract ###
This is a small book â€“ but exceedingly large in useful content.This is just one positive comment of the many that could have been selected to open this review, on a helpful book where the delivery of well-presented and updated knowledge on the field of stigma and discrimination is for the sole purpose of prompting and guiding action. But, however appropriate this opening comment may be, it will be incomplete if the reviewer would not hastily add that the book is impregnated by a deep commitment to remove stigma, and more emphatically, discrimination in all walks of life, both ugly expressions of social injustice (cf. chapter 6).
