### Abstract ###
Purpose: The objective of this study was to examine the interrelationships among individualism, collectivism, homosexuality-related stigma, social support, and condom use among Chinese men who have sex with men.Methods: A cross-sectional study using the respondent-driven sampling approach was conducted among 351 eligible men who have sex with men in Shenzhen, China. Path analytic modeling was used to analyze the interrelationships.Results: The results of path analytic modeling document the following statistically significant associations: (1) higher levels of vertical collectivism were associated with higher levels of public homosexual stigma [β (standardized coefficient) = 0.12] and self homosexual stigma (β = 0.12); (2) higher levels of vertical individualism were associated with higher levels self homosexual stigma (β = 0.18); (3) higher levels of horizontal individualism were associated with higher levels of public homosexual stigma (β = 0.12); (4) higher levels of self homosexual stigma were associated with higher levels of social support from sexual partners (β = 0.12); and (5) lower levels of public homosexual stigma were associated with consistent condom use (β = -0.19).Conclusions: The findings enhance our understanding of how individualist and collectivist cultures influence the development of homosexuality-related stigma, which in turn may affect individuals’ decisions to engage in HIV-protective practices and seek social support. Accordingly, the development of HIV interventions for men who have sex with men in China should take the characteristics of Chinese culture into consideration.10.5463/sra.v1i1.16
