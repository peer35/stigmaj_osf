### Abstract ###
Purpose: The current study examines the effectiveness of an intervention to reduce explicit and implicit measures of stigma toward mental illness and treatment-seeking, and increasing indicators of willingness to seek treatment.Method: Adolescents were randomly assigned to the experimental (education about mental illness and treatment) or control (education about tobacco) intervention, involving psychoeducation and contact with an affected individual.Results: Results suggested the stigma intervention was effective at reducing explicit but not implicit measures of stigma. As hypothesized, participants receiving the experimental intervention reported less explicit stigma toward treatment. Also, individuals receiving the experimental intervention reported greater openness to personally seek treatment if they had also reported prior mental health treatment.Conclusions and Implications: These findings support the potential for a brief educational intervention among adolescents to reduce negative attitudes toward mental health treatment, but raise questions about how to effectively address implicit stigma as well as the importance of translating stigma reduction into behavior changes.
