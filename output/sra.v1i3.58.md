### Abstract ###
‘What’s in a name? This is an open letter about a new name for schizophrenia in the DSM-5. Anoiksis, the Dutch patient society of and for people with a susceptibility to psychoses or schizophrenia, has lobbied the American Psychiatric Association for a new name for schizophrenia. The most recent suggestion — Bleuler’s Syndrome — is intended to do justice also to the negative and cognitive symptoms in the syndrome. This appears to correspond in part with the ideas of the chair of the appropriate American Psychiatric Association’s Work Group. The issue now is to gain support from the international mental health community.
