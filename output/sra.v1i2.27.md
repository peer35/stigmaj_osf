### Abstract ###
Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore how stigma is perceived and experienced by people with mental illness who are legally required to use mental health services while living in the community.Method: Interviews were conducted with 91 people with mental illness who were receiving compulsory community mental health treatment in British Columbia, Canada. An inductive thematic analytic framework was used to identify predominant themes and recurring patterns in the qualitative data.Results: Participantsâ€™ narratives centered around six primary themes: (a) compulsory treatment; (b) feeling/being knocked down; (c) public (mis)understanding; (d) social identity/location; (e) social disadvantage; and (f) passing-managing-overcoming. Compulsory community treatment was entangled with a myriad of other stigma-producing factors associated with the direct effects of mental illness and social disadvantage.Conclusion: Compulsory community mental health treatment is not the predominant issue that produces stigma among people with mental illness, but it may contribute to such experiences by creating situations where people are likely to feel powerless, devalued, and oppressed.
