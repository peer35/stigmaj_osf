### Abstract ###
Purpose: This study examined negative attitudes toward overweight peers among pre-adolescents using different explicit and implicit measures and analyzed their relationships with self-reported Body Mass Index (BMI).Methods: Two hundred and twenty-four 7th and 8th graders enrolled in physical education classes from an urban school served as participants in this study. Anti-Fat Attitudes Test, Implicit Association Test, and BMI were administered during their regular class time.Results: Adolescents surveyed had moderately high implicit biases toward obese individuals in almost all areas. Partial weak correlations were observed between explicit and implicit bias. Participants who had lower BMI were likely to assign higher scores on the implicit smart/stupid and good/bad subscales, suggesting that thinner adolescents tend to be more implicitly biased.Conclusions: Results suggest that interventions to reduce bias may need to be comprehensive so that they can fully affect an individualâ€™s implicit biases in all measured areas.10.5463/sra.v1i1.12
